        <p><div></div><strong>Description:</strong>    A blog that follows my journey into the world of tech. 
        <div><strong>Intention:</strong>    As my 1st "official" project, I wanted to build something I could continue developing over time. I wanted my first project to be something personal and professional that I could share with everyone. Miranda's blog 🌸 is my personal brand and archive where I document my growth, showcase my consistency and express my creativity as I transition into tech.</div> </p>
