        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div><p>I recently left my 10+ year career in the food and beverage industry to persue a new career in tech. During that time, I developed my strong skills in leadership, training and maintaining high standards in fast-paced environments.</p></div>
        <div><p>I enjoy problem solving, looking at the finer details and creating things that improve systems. Outside of coding I enjoy reading, watching thrillers and anime, staying active through walking, hiking, tennis. I also enjoy learning through trying new experiences.</p></div>
        <div><p>I'm not usually one to journal or blog but I am becoming.🌱</p></div>
