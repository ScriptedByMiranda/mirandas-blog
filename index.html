        <h3>Day 1</h3>
        <p> Today I worked a couple of hours studying css. I've realized I can't keep trying to come up with the "perfect learning plan" or perfect schedule and I just need to start. This is somthing I'll be activley working on..</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Day 2</h3>
        <p>Spent an additional hour in deep focus mode, which felt great. In spite of trying out a new learning environment with more distractions, I stayed focused! I'm going to steadily increase my deep focus time, or the time I spend studying, steadily to avoid burnout and keep the quality of my learning.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Day 3</h3>
        <p>Worked on building Miranda's Blog and polishing the css. Spent more time on project work than lecture, and still learned so much. Looking forward to uploading this to GitHub. </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Day 4</h3>
        <p>When sitting down to study theory for extended periods of time gets hard, you gotta make it interesting. In my case that means playing professor to my two cats and dog. They are the cutest students! 🥰</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Day 5</h3>
        <p>After two days of running errands and spending time with family it feels great to get back to learning. Setting the envirmonment is crucial for me. This makes all the difference for having a productive and succesful day. #Gottahavemymatcha 🍵</p>
